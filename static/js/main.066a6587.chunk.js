This is not to say that the person I fell in love with was not a real person. Rather, the love itself was a fantasy, a figment of my own imagination. Nevertheless, it was an intense affair, beginning with a brief encounter, and quickly blossoming into a fully-fledged romance (or, as my parents would come to call it, an obsession). I plastered pictures of my loved ones face to every inch of my bedroom walls, creating a grotesque shrine. I wrote songs about this person, I wrote fan letters. I made it my mission to know everything that there was to know about them, fostering an infatuation so intense that it now causes my body to physically recoil with embarrassment.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>The cult of celebrity is a feature of contemporary society that wields an unprecedented amount of power over the obsessed individual. We have come to idolize certain desirable human beings not only for their talents, but also (perhaps more importantly) for who we think they are. S\xe9raphine Pick\u2019s large-scale painting Superstar conveys the intensity of our cultural obsession with celebrity figures. Standing before the work is an immersive experience, like being hurled into an icy ocean. It enthralls and absorbs. It invites us to enter into the psyche of the crowd, to bask in the presence of the admired superstar.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Looking at it, I am transported back to my first concert experiences. A sea of bodies surrounds me; I am being crushed between them. They jostle and wrestle and sway. There is a buzz of excitement in the air, bordering on anxiety. Everybody is desperate to be in the front row. They grapple to reach out and touch the arm occasionally offered by the superstar, as if the feeling of skin upon skin would leave a trace of his or her greatness; as if it would confirm that the object of desire really is human too. The intense blue is reminiscent of the monochrome paintings of Yves Klein. Limiting the colour palette to such an electrifying hue is mesmerizing in quite an inexplicable way. It is a colour full of energy, and yet this energy does not ward the viewer off. Rather it creates, like Klein\u2019s paintings, a sense of boundlessness that invites the viewer into its utopian world full of endless possibilities.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Love is never a rational sensation. When people fall in love with celebrities, it is an even more irrational thing, because the object of that love is a perfect version of a human being who does not truly exist. The celebrity chosen becomes the center of a fantasy, onto which the desires of the fan are projected. While in reality the celebrity figure is unknowable and completely out of reach, in an individual\u2019s fantasy they can become completely knowable, and are put within reach. The fan is able to possess the celebrity for themselves, to form whatever relationship with this fantasy figure that they desire. The Internet has broken down pre-existing barriers. It has allowed us access to a multitude of information. We can conduct an online search for a celebrity and be immediately satisfied with pictures, videos, filmographies, discographies, every piece of information one could hope to know. Pick\u2019s awareness of the Internet\u2019s vital role in this strange cultural phenomenon, and her use of a photograph from the Internet as source imagery for this painting, makes Superstar both about, and also of, the contemporary age that we now live in.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Superstar is in many ways a fantastical image. The downward brushstrokes create the sensation of being cleansed in a spectral rainfall. The painting conveys the intense longing to be near the superstar, to know everything about them, and perhaps to be metamorphosed into them. There is a sense of the individual transcending reality, almost leaving her own body to rejoice in the music, and in the feeling of being present in the same space as the superstar. Celebrity worship is considered to be an abnormality, a psychological condition. And in many ways, this kind of obsession makes no logical sense. It can only true make sense to the one that is obsessed. It cannot be at all theoretically justified, because individual emotion and desire is not something that can be accessed or logically explained. Desire of all kinds has a mystical quality to it. Superstar has visually captured the feeling of what it is to worship a celebrity\u2014a feeling that is so difficult to put into words.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Celebrity worship fulfills the desires of the fan, and nobody else. It may in fact have very little to do with the actual celebrity as a person, and more with the idea of them that has been created by the fan. The face of the girl in the center is the only one that is fully realised in Pick\u2019s painting. She is placed beneath a spotlight, emphasizing that she (and not the faceless and nameless superstar) is the true focus of this painting. By extension, the girl is also the focus of her own obsession. She has, through fantasy projected onto the superstar, created an image of where she wants herself to be.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>At the same time that it is entrancing, the painting disturbs. There is desperateness to the desire of the people surrounding the main figure. Hands emerge like talons, aching to touch the desired object. They have been effaced, and are therefore made all the more terrifying.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Years after my first love fizzles out, I take my sister to a concert, where the celebrity she now loves strums his guitar and sings; yet the screams of adolescent girls all around me drown out his every word. I am an outsider in this crowd. I am experiencing these adolescents\u2019 obsession, yet I am not a willing participant. It is like being in a human washing machine\u2014surrounded by other damp and dirty bodies, unable to escape. Girls faint on each side of me, they have to be pulled out and dowsed with water. I want to be lifted out of there too, to a cool, quiet place, where there is no sweating, no yelling, no pulling of hair. I think about how terrifying life must be for this man on the stage: to be followed and screamed at and tackled every day of his life, probably even when he is just walking, head down, to the corner store to buy a pint of milk.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>I have never met a superstar. They have ceased to interest me. I had practically forgotten about that brief time in my life where I thought I was in love with one of them, and then I came upon Pick\u2019s painting, which was hanging on the second floor of the Kelburn library. I had forgotten, not the fact of my obsession, but what this obsession really felt like. This painting gripped me. Superstar is incredible not only for its profound social commentary or for its transfixing aesthetic, but also for the aura it projects and the sensations it evokes\u2014the sensation of both euphoria and claustrophobia that accompanies the act of loving somebody so completely unattainable. This kind of love is unhealthy, and yet it is a far more common affliction of modern society than we may normally think. It is the result of many drastic transformations that have taken place in the last one hundred years, and is entirely of our time.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>The Superstar has risen, and along with it, those who blindly follow.</p>","award":"Adam Foundation Essay Writing Prize Winner","publisher":"Adam Art Gallery","url":"http://www.adamartgallery.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TheStarsInOurEyes_Sinead-Overbye2017.pdf"},{"id":2,"year":"2018","title":"The Disappeared","poem":"<p class=\\"p1\\">You wake up one day and she\u2019s gone.

She is not in the hallway, talking into everyone\u2019s rooms all at once, telling them all about that boy that she met at that party and how <em>nice</em> he was, no boy had ever been so <em>nice</em> to her before. She is not in the bathroom putting on your nude lip liner (which she never gave back, in the end). She is not at her mirror cutting her fringe as short as the width of a finger. <em>What\u2019s the point in having a fringe that you can\u2019t even see?

But Riley wants her to be here tonight, she had no one else to go with, and so here she is. It\u2019ll be good for her to get out and socialise.

It takes him a moment too long to register their presence.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Oh hey,\u2019 he says to Riley, \u2018It\u2019s so sick that you came.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Kendall knows Jade the new-fashioned way. She\u2019s seen him tagged in countless photos on Facebook and Instagram. He\u2019s friends with Kendall\u2019s old flatmate Nick. She looks around, panicked at the thought of Nick showing up, with his whisky breath and blue eyes like arrows shooting through her. He isn\u2019t here, thank god. Kendall crawls back into her head and yells at herself to calm down.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I\u2019m Kendall.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I know who you are.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You\u2019re friends with Nick right?\u2019 asks Riley.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Kind of, yeah.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018He used to flat with Kendall. Isn\u2019t that crazy? Such a small world.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Kendall\u2019s eye twitches at the mention of Nick. It doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.

She wants to curl up into a ball and stop breathing.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The music is raw and edgy, and everybody\u2019s pounding their heads against the air, like they\u2019re trying to smash it into pieces. The floor beneath them curves downwards every time they jump.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Kendall holds her vodka like a weapon in her hands and jerks from side to side, trying to pretend that she\u2019s enjoying herself. It isn\u2019t good music to dance to, but nobody else seems to have a problem. She shuts her eyes and imagines herself back in her kitchen, dancing alone.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The song ends. Everyone starts to jostle and cheer. She lets the crowd take her. She isn\u2019t ready to be here, with all these warm bodies colliding against her. She wants to go home, before things get really bad.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Riley leans in to say something Kendall can\u2019t hear. She repeats the something twice before finally pointing towards the back door and making a smoking gesture. They wrestle their way out. Jade\u2019s waiting at the edge of the crowd. He touches Kendall\u2019s waist as she walks past and she wants to pick him up and throw him out the window.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">They sit around the bonfire and smoke a joint. Another guy sits across from them, drawing swirling patterns into the dirt with a long stick. She thinks about asking him whether they mean anything, but she doesn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t even get as far as asking his name. She can\u2019t move. She\u2019s stuck in a fishbowl and she\u2019ll never get out. Her eyes follow along with his patterns. They\u2019re rhythmic and flowing, almost sensual.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Jade fills the silence with his own observations, while Riley takes a few languorous drags on the joint and passes it back to Kendall.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018That kind of experience,\u2019 says Jade, \u2018It makes you really reflect on what you want\u2026 It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been living my life in fast forward\u2026 I need to slow down, you know, it all needs to slow down\u2026\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The words appear before her without context. Kendall latches onto them before they dissipate. Everything needs to slow down. She\u2019s receding from the bonfire: there she is, from behind, the tattoo of a moon in the crest of her neck, and there are Riley and Jade sitting next to each other, and there\u2019s the guy drawing patterns, over and over. They\u2019re all talking to each other, then to her, then they stare into the flames. She tries to reach out for them, but a thick piece of glass gets in her way.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Are we going to find the answers do you think?\u2019 Kendall says.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018The answers to what?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I\u2026 I dunno\u2026 I can\u2019t remember\u2026 What were we just talking about?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">They\u2019re all staring at her now.

There\u2019s a poster of Blondie on the wall. A group of girls in miniskirted girls do lines through rolled-up five dollar notes. They lean against the desk and their skirts ride higher up their thighs, and then they jerk their necks and sniff.

Time and music. But there\u2019s no music in this room, just the thudding of bass from far off in the lounge, and the sound of Riley and Jade talking. The miniskirt girls are gone and now some other guy with bleach blonde dreads is sitting on the foot of the bed, next to Jade, nodding along with everything he says.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">From inside the fishbowl, everyone is distorted, distant. She can feel Jade\u2019s eyes on her collarbone, but she\u2019s making an effort not to look at him.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stop &nbsp; &nbsp;looking &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;me &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and why</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the fuck &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; did &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you grab &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fingers?</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">You all good? Riley asks. This might be the fifth time she\u2019s said it. Kendall stands up.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Bathroom, she says loudly. The dreadlock guy looks up, concerned at the sudden burst of noise.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can you hear me &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Riley &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through the fishbowl?</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">11:43.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She\u2019s in another bedroom. There are patches of red wine on the carpet, and the girl with dangling green earrings is shaking salt into the marks.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Rubbing salt in the wound, haha,\u2019 says Kendall.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The girl\u2019s dark eyes are on her.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Ha-ha,\u2019 she says, in slow motion.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Does it work?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018It\u2019s a household hack. I saw it on YouTube.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Sounds like a fun place.

Kendall passes Sam her vodka and they each take turns wincing as they drink. Now that they\u2019re sitting so close, she notices that Sam\u2019s long green earrings are connected letters that spell out the word AMEN.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Are you religious?\u2019 Kendall asks.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Your earrings. They say amen.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Sam laughs, and when she does she throws her head all the way back. Kendall\u2019s never seen anyone do that before.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Na, I got them from this shop in Thailand, called The Pink Pussy.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">It\u2019s Kendall\u2019s turn to laugh. She\u2019s floating downstream on a large magnolia petal and she feels wondrously, absolutely fine.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Sam rolls a cigarette. They light it up. The door is open, and the room\u2019s already filled with smoke. The fridge is strapped into an alcove with black duct tape, and keeps bouncing, like it\u2019s desperate to escape.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Crazy fridge!\u2019 says Kendall.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I was thinking the same thing!\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The vodka bottle is empty. Kendall puts the last of the cigarette into it and they watch it burn to a nub.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Do you wanna go outside?\u2019 Sam asks. Their fingers have met in a sort of tangle on the small space of bench between them. Kendall\u2019s lost track of time. She tugs her hand away and laughs.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">They climb a tree in the backyard. Kendall doesn\u2019t climb trees, but Sam does, and Kendall\u2019s forgetting everything. She can see everyone from here, and no one can see her unless they were to look up. Sam\u2019s talking about photography.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018It\u2019s so radical, when you think about it,\u2019 she says, swinging her legs. \u2018I mean, imagine a time before photography, and staring at a lattice window or a hat or something and thinking, I wonder if I could have this image, this thing I\u2019m looking at at this very moment, to hold as an object forever. It just blows my mind.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018It\u2019s so much to think about,\u2019 Kendall says. \u2018It\u2019s like time travel.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I know,\u2019 says Sam. \u2018It\u2019s like stopping death.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Their hands are together again, and it looks so beautiful that she wants to take a photograph. There\u2019s a silence between them that stretches on. Sam\u2019s staring at Kendall\u2019s lips, and Kendall isn\u2019t scared at all.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I like tonight,\u2019 she says. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like tonight.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Why\u2019s that?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I\u2019m not a party person,\u2019 she says.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Why not?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Kendall stares down at the bonfire. The guy with the stick has turned towards the bushes and is slashing them violently.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018It\u2019s not my vibe,\u2019 she says after a while.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You don\u2019t need to tell me anything,\u2019 Sam says.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018There\u2019s just this guy\u2026 an old flatmate\u2026\u2019 Kendall stops. \u2018I used to go to lots of parties.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Sam squeezes her hand and then lets go. She swings down from the tree and lands skilfully on both feet, then holds out her hand again.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Dance with me,\u2019 she says.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The band\u2019s still playing. Kendall nods along and sways in an interpretive way that makes her feel like coral in the current. Everyone\u2019s in their own little fishbowl, dancing. No one but Sam can touch her.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She moves to the front of the crowd, where there\u2019s more room, and she can see the band. They\u2019re all skeletal and have red around their eyes. The singer clutches the microphone like he\u2019ll die if he doesn\u2019t. Droplets of his sweat land on Kendall\u2019s face. She feels cleansed. Sam\u2019s arms are around her waist, and she\u2019s kissing her neck, and Kendall doesn\u2019t care if anyone sees.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">(Only it isn\u2019t Sam. It\u2019s that guy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and his whisky hands</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2014or breath, whatever\u2014 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;doesn\u2019t matter</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">what he smelled like &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it matters &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what he did\u2014)</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 Sam asks.

Sam pulls her through the crowds as the people grow closer together, squashing her in. She needs to get out. Find Riley. She needs to check if she\u2019s okay. Where she is. She shouldn\u2019t have left her there. In that room. She should\u2019ve stayed.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Kendall,\u2019 Sam says. \u2018Are you alright?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Everybody\u2019s jumping. The floorboards moan. Kendall\u2019s head is swimming from the alcohol. She feels like she\u2019s been blindfolded and sent to fumble in the dark. She plunges through the sludge of people who cling to one another like they\u2019re drowning. Sam\u2019s voice still floats around her, \u2018Kendall? What\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She\u2019s at the edges of the fishbowl now, she\u2019s almost out.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">There are too many doors. Kendall can\u2019t remember which is which. She feels like Alice from that movie about Alice. She opens a door and it\u2019s Sam\u2019s room. She opens a door and it\u2019s someone else, vomiting. She opens a door and it\u2019s empty.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Behind the final door, Riley\u2019s splayed out underneath the Blondie poster, and Jade\u2019s on top of her. He\u2019s got his pants half-off, and her clothes are floating around her weirdly. She looks like a rotting hibiscus flower. He\u2019s got a tight grip on both of her wrists. Jade glares at Kendall, and Riley gives her an absent look like she\u2019s asleep with her eyes open.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Sam pushes past and says, \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Kendall backs away.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Afterwards, she\u2019ll wonder why she didn\u2019t stay. That would\u2019ve been logical. It would\u2019ve been kind. In the moment though, she panics. There\u2019s a voice inside her head yelling: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GET &nbsp; &nbsp; OUT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OF &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THERE GET &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OUT.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She sits on the roadside, smoking. Her knees are grazed. A green bruise blooms on her shin and the smoke scrapes painfully against her throat. Sam wanders down the hillside to find her. They don\u2019t say anything to one another, just pass a cigarette shakily back and forth. Her mouth tastes like metal and dirt. She sees Blondie in her mind\u2019s eyes, pouting.

She was vaguely aware of a pressure on her arm. She was also aware that the light had been turned on, and Chloe\u2019s voice had reached a much higher decibel than was appropriate for the middle of the night.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What is it?\u2019 Stella asked.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018There\u2019s a rat in our room.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018A what?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018A fucking <em>rat. In our fucking room</em>.\u2019 The pressure on her arm turned out to be Chloe\u2019s hand. She was gripping Stella tightly, trying to shake her awake. \u2018Haven\u2019t you been listening to me?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Babe\u2026 I was sleeping\u2026\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I don\u2019t understand how you could sleep when there\u2019s a dirty rodent nibbling at our shoes.\u2019 Chloe looked as if she\u2019d just been through a car wash. Her hair was sticking up all over the place. \u2018What if it eats them?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I don\u2019t think rats actually like the taste of leather\u2026\u2019 Stella tugged her arm from Chloe\u2019s grip. She was trying to understand, but really, did Chloe have to talk so loudly? It was 3am for Chrissake.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018They might do! What then? It\u2019s not like I can afford to just go out and buy another pair.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Your shoes are safe,\u2019 Stella said. In the silence that followed, she scanned the corner of the room. She couldn\u2019t see anything, but could faintly make out the sound of scratching, and fought the urge to shudder. She didn\u2019t want Chloe to see her afraid. She had to be cool, calm and collected. It would be no use to either of them if she broke down now. In her mind, though, she was imagining a giant bedraggled rodent as large as her own torso, with fangs like sharpened pencils.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What are we gonna do? Should we kill it?\u2019 Chloe asked. Her hands were gripping the duvet, and she was pulling it up over herself, pulling it off Stella, who shivered. Moments passed and Stella didn\u2019t reply, so Chloe added, \u2018I think we should try to find it.\u2019 And by \u2018we\u2019 they both knew that she meant \u2018you\u2019.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">It wasn\u2019t that Chloe didn\u2019t like rats \u2013 in fact, she thought they were really cute \u2013 it was just that she didn\u2019t want to know what it looked like because it probably had to die. It\u2019d entered her space \u2013 <em>their</em> space \u2013 now, and so what else were they supposed to do? Let it rummage around forever? Let it give them some kind of disease?</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The bed creaked as Stella climbed out, seeming so cool about it all. Chloe shrank further under the covers and put the duvet in her mouth, trying not to make a sound. Stella would get angry if she overreacted, but Chloe had been lying there for half an hour at least, listening to the scurrying sounds, and the idea of the rat had burrowed into her brain and festered. Every time she thought of it, the rat got larger and she became more powerless to ward him off.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The scratching stopped. Now neither of them could tell where it might be. Stella bent down slowly and picked up a shoe, turned it in her hand, shook it. How could she be so un-phased by it all?</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018He must be hiding,\u2019 said Chloe. Stella rolled her eyes, then continued to turn each individual shoe. Chloe braced herself for the moment the rat would come flying out and scratch her face away with its powerful claws.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">There was nothing there.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018But I heard it!\u2019 said Chloe from within her duvet bundle, \u2018I heard it nibbling and scratching, and then I saw its little grey face peering up at me!\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella had overturned the entire room, while Chloe sat on her island, shuddering. Surely she could\u2019ve been a bit more helpful.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Well, it\u2019s not here anymore,\u2019 Stella said. \u2018It must\u2019ve squeezed back under the door when we weren\u2019t watching or something.\u2019 She was consoling herself more than anything. Her arms were tired. It was now 3:26 am, and if she didn\u2019t go to bed soon she\u2019d be a thundercloud at uni tomorrow. \u2018Clo, I\u2019ve really got to get some rest.\u2019 She tugged the sheets back from Chloe\u2019s grip, huddling beneath them. \u2018We\u2019ll see if we can find it tomorrow.\u2019 And before Chloe could protest, Stella was asleep.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The rodent was climbing on top of their bed and gnawing at Chloe\u2019s right calf, and she was screaming. Stella tried to bash the rat over the head with a dictionary, but it was expanding, it was as big as Chloe now, it kept gnawing and gnawing, and her leg was made of polystyrene, so she couldn\u2019t feel anything. Her polystyrene leg was getting torn up into shreds, and the shreds were disappearing up into the air, and Stella was trying to yell something at her, but Chloe couldn\u2019t hear her, she couldn\u2019t even lip-read, because now she was blind, and in a glass box, and the rat was crawling on top of her, and the rat was a pile of bricks, she could feel them heavy on her chest, and she\u2019d left the milk open on the kitchen bench, she\u2019d never be able to say sorry, because now she wasn\u2019t able to breathe.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">When she woke up, Stella was already in the kitchen with a half-full plunger of coffee and a bowl of rice bubbles. Her red-rimmed eyes told Chloe she hadn\u2019t slept, but it was too early in the day to feel worried about anything.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I found the hole,\u2019 said Stella. \u2018I\u2019m thinking of getting it boarded up.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What hole?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018The hole the rat came through.\u2019 Stella looked at her with something resembling disgust. Chloe didn\u2019t say anything, just sat down and drank some coffee too, then checked Facebook. No notifications. No one else to talk to. Sometimes she wondered if that was just what happened when you lived alone with someone. Everyone probably just assumed you\u2019d made a life that was cosy and important. It probably seemed like she and Stella didn\u2019t need anyone else but each other.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Did you hear what I said?\u2019 asked Stella. \u2018About the hole?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">It was too early in the day for a fight. Chloe crawled back into her brain and didn\u2019t reply.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella regretted what she\u2019d said at the breakfast table. She regretted many things, like that time at the farmer\u2019s market where she\u2019d been hungover from a terrible party and couldn\u2019t keep track of all the children on scooters \u2013 it was meant to be picturesque, but it was stressful \u2013 and she\u2019d just kept snapping at Chloe for hours about every little thing she did, because that was how things were. They were so used to one another that they were allowed to do things like that.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She drank three coffees before 10am, and her arms had started shaking. Her eyes were achy and swollen.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Rough night?\u2019 Maddie asked as they sat in the lecture theatre.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018We\u2019ve got a rat in our house,\u2019 said Stella simply.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Oh right,\u2019 said Maddie. \u2018You should get one of those live traps.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella wanted the rat dead. She couldn\u2019t explain why. She just had this feeling that if the rat actually died, it\u2019d be an actual ending. There was no risk of him coming back in. They didn\u2019t have a car to drive a rat far enough from the house anyway. He\u2019d just keep returning. Killing him was the only option. It was the only way to be truly rid of him.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Chloe tidied the house, because she hadn\u2019t really done much else to help with the rat situation. She took the rubbish out. She even boarded up the hole in the wall with bits of wood that she\u2019d been meaning to use for a sculpture. The rat issue was more important. She didn\u2019t want Stella to be angry at her anymore, just because she couldn\u2019t bring herself to be proactive about the situation.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She took a nap at around 2pm, but was woken up soon after by more scratching, and the sound of a small body tumbling across the ground. The rat was still there. She found what supplies they had and set to work building a trap \u2013 something kind, that wouldn\u2019t harm him, but that would help her to catch him as he ran past. She had a creeping feeling of the rat\u2019s eyes staring at her from the ground. She hoped that he wouldn\u2019t emerge. She hoped that he\u2019d find his way out of the front door. She\u2019d left it open so he could go.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">When Stella got home, the bedroom was covered in plastic bags.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 she asked when she opened the door. Chloe was lying contentedly on the bed at the far end of the room. She had a cardboard box beside her, and was scrolling down her Facebook feed.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I made a trap!\u2019 Chloe said, but Stella continued to stare.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I don\u2019t get it?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018The plastic is so that I can hear the rat moving when it comes. I\u2019ve put little blocks of cheese on the plastic bags, and pinned them down to the floor. So if the plastic moves, and the rat comes, they will eat the cheese, but they won\u2019t be able to take it away, because it\u2019s pinned to the floor. Then while they are eating the cheese I can use this,\u2019 Chloe held up the cardboard box, \u2018and I\u2019ll be able to trap it!\u2019 She seemed pleased with herself.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella looked at Chloe and decided not to ask if she\u2019d left the house today, or if she\u2019d tried applying for a new job, or if she\u2019d bothered to go supermarket shopping. She seemed to spend most of her days not doing anything, while Stella made the effort to get out and make something of herself. Stella just asked, \u2018Have you slept yet?\u2019 and Chloe said, \u2018Not at all!\u2019 her voice jittering.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You should sleep now, I\u2019ll be on rat duty.\u2019 In four long strides, Stella traversed the plasticky sea between them and took the box from Chloe\u2019s hands, feeling like some sort of hero.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Chloe was bad at sleeping. She\u2019d never really known how to do it properly. Most of the time, she was practically nocturnal. She\u2019d ghost around the house in her ugg boots, and make endless cups of tea and hum to herself. Sometimes she\u2019d go to the back of their garden and lie down in the grass and smoke, trying to read the stars, but she\u2019d never really known how to do that either.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">It took fifteen minutes for Stella\u2019s breath to slow, but Chloe was still wide awake. She needed to get over this fear of killing. She needed to just do it. Tomorrow, she decided, she\u2019d put out a real rat trap, and she\u2019d capture it. She wouldn\u2019t flinch when she saw it lying there dead, she would just calmly throw it in the bin, and they\u2019d go on living their lives.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">But she didn\u2019t understand how the rat trap worked. The instructions were simple, yet her mind was buzzing, making the words seem complicated and unfamiliar \u2013 meaningless symbols on a page. She was afraid she would set it up wrong and lose a finger.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Babe, can you help me with this?\u2019 Chloe yelled towards the kitchen.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You just put the cheese on the thing and then flip the other thing over.\u2019 Stella appeared in the doorway, holding a jar of jam and eating it with a spoon.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018That isn\u2019t helpful. Can you just come and do it please?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Fine.\u2019 Stella put the jar down on the coffee table and knelt beside her, placing the cheese on its tiny pedestal, and fixing the other parts into place. \u2018It\u2019ll be nice to get a good nights sleep,\u2019 she said, once it was done.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The rat was smaller than either of them had imagined \u2013 no bigger than a teaspoon. The metal bar of the trap was clamped firmly around its neck, and its arms were reaching out, like someone falling down a well, desperate to find a handhold. Stella and Chloe both stared down at it silently. The air felt dehydrated and empty between them.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018What do we do now?\u2019 Chloe asked, without looking up.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018We could bury it?\u2019 Stella suggested, and Chloe agreed, because it was just such a tiny thing, and they should treat it as if it meant something to the world. Stella bent down with the cardboard box in her hand, prised the rat\u2019s grey body out, and placed it solemnly into the box.</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">*</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella dug a hole in the back garden, and lowered the cardboard coffin into it. The rat was dead. They had killed it. But in the end, nothing else had changed. There was still the waking up every day. There was still a slow burning. The rat had just been a distraction, a bit of something new to cut through the mundane.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Stella felt two arms going around her, and it was only then that she realised she was crying. \u2018It\u2019s just a rat,\u2019 Chloe said into her ear.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t just a rat.\u2019 Stella said sternly, but she didn\u2019t know if Chloe would understand. She felt herself alone on a detached lily pad, floating downstream, with the air moving fast behind her.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018We\u2019ll be okay,\u2019 Chloe said. \u2018It\u2019s all going to be okay.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p3\\"> <br> </p>","award":"","publisher":"Starling Issue 7","url":"https://www.starlingmag.com/issue-7/sinead-overbye"},{"id":7,"year":"2019","title":"Protea Neriifolia","poem":"<p class=\\"p1\\">They adopt a baby bird and move into a place of their own.

The nest takes shape, although it doesn\u2019t turn out exactly how she thinks it should. It\u2019s mangled-looking, with scraps of paper sticking up everywhere.

He makes a chiming sound and she strokes the silver spot behind his neck. <br>\u2018Why don\u2019t we just buy a cage?\u2019 says Hana from her corner of the room, where she sits folding their clothes into drawers. \u2018Isn\u2019t that what normal people do?\u2019 <br>\u2018Cages are too sad,\u2019 says Olive. <br>The bird sits in the nest now, cleaning his wings. They aren\u2019t completely sure what kind of bird he is. He\u2019s still so small. He has black feathers, with one long silver streak behind his neck, and his song changes every time he opens his beak. <br>\u2018What shall we call him?\u2019 Olive steps down from the ladder to observe her creation. It\u2019s a lopsided mess, but the bird tucks himself down into it and seems content. <br>\u2018How about Rasputin?\u2019 says Hana. <br>\u2018No way.\u2019 <br>\u2018Rufus?\u2019 <br>\u2018Oh my god.\u2019 <br>\u2018What about Buddy?\u2019 <br>\u2018Oh, that\u2019s nice. Do you like that, little bird?\u2019 <br>He looks at her and loudly squawks. </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">They sit at the dining table drinking plunger coffee. Hana scrolls through Facebook, and Olive tries to think of something interesting to say. They\u2019ve hardly spoken in weeks, but it hasn\u2019t been for lack of trying. She thought it\u2019d be different if they moved in together, just the two of them, and for a while it had been. They\u2019d smoked together on the balcony with the bird scratching the ash from the glass ashtray onto the ground. They\u2019d watched movies in the lounge every night and quoted them back to one another in bed. <br>Now, they\u2019re too busy with their new jobs. Every morning they sit in silence. Hana watches buzzfeed videos and doesn\u2019t speak. Olive peels her split ends apart and says her thoughts aloud just to fill the silence. <br>\u2018I found this new podcast yesterday,\u2019 she says. Hana keeps watching a video of a capybara playing with three snowy puppies. The capybara is unmoving. The puppies tumble all over him. \u2018It\u2019s really interesting. It\u2019s about feminism, but it\u2019s not one of those vapid ones where all those wealthy white women sit in a room and congratulate themselves for donating to charity. It\u2019s just, like, more relaxed. And funny. Really funny.\u2019 <br>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 <br>\u2018I was just trying to start a conversation,\u2019 Olive pours another mug of coffee and takes a bite of her toast, which has turned cold. The peanut butter sticks unpleasantly to the roof of her mouth. <br>\u2018I didn\u2019t hear you.\u2019 Hana shuts her laptop and looks Olive straight in the eyes. \u2018Better now?\u2019 <br>\u2018You never listen to me.\u2019 <br>\u2018Jesus, Olive. Stop.\u2019 <br>This isn\u2019t how this was supposed to go. They should be able to talk to each other for five minutes. <br>Hana locks herself in the bathroom. The rushing shower water is the only sound in the apartment. Even Buddy stays silent, sitting on the table next to Olive\u2019s breakfast, staring at the bathroom door. <br>Olive straightens her hair and does her makeup. Her work uniform smells like day-old perfume. Buddy sings and flaps carefree around the room. \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still happy, little bird.\u2019 She purses her lips and whistles a reply. <br>When she steps into the lounge Hana\u2019s already dressed, with her hair in a bun and a cigarette between her lips. <br>\u2018Will I see you tonight?\u2019 says Olive. <br>Hana shrugs and says, \u2018I need some space.\u2019 </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Four months ago, when Hana last needed space, she\u2019d gone off for two days and had come home drunk and crying, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I love you, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 <br>She wrapped her arms around Olive so tightly that it hurt her ribs. Olive was only half awake, and lazily patted Hana\u2019s head. \u2018Sleep,\u2019 she said. <br>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so dumb, I\u2019m so dumb, I love you, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 <br>When Olive fully came awake, she had the uncanny feeling of knowing exactly what Hana was going to say before she said it. <br>\u2018I was drunk,\u2019 said Hana. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 <br>\u2018Who with?\u2019 <br>For weeks afterwards, Olive walked around with a sick feeling in her chest. She lost her breath at the traffic lights. She started feeling panicked at work, and spent half an hour in the toilet every day, vomiting up her lunch. It came in bitter chunks that were hard to get out, she had to scrape it from the back of her throat with a finger. <br>But then Hana had been so nice. She\u2019d taken her to the movies. She\u2019d taken her shopping, and told Olive she looked pretty in everything. She\u2019d bought her a flower from the supermarket, which was giant and pink and had the fuzz of something black and vaguely pubic around its closed petals. Olive laughed because it was so ugly, and Hana said, it\u2019s nice to see you smile. They decided to move out of their mouldy flat in Kelburn and into the apartment, and they\u2019d worked through it. Because that\u2019s what adults did. You didn\u2019t just throw away two years worth of love because of some drunken encounter with an anonymous guy in a nightclub. You kept going, even if it made you feel like tearing off your skin, even if it meant in the morning you no longer recognised the person you were sleeping next to. </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Olive lies on her side of the bed with the lamp on, staring at the bumps in the wallpaper, listening for the click of the front door. Hours pass. Unruly faces emerge from the walls and mock her with their changing expressions. <br>Buddy hops anxiously around on the bed until Olive finally gets up and follows him into the lounge. For a moment she isn\u2019t sure of exactly where she is. There\u2019s the television, with its blue light glowing. There\u2019s a stack of library books she still hasn\u2019t read. There are the couch cushions with pictures of Pope Francis printed onto them that they\u2019d found at a second hand shop over a year ago. It doesn\u2019t feel like any of it belongs to her. It\u2019s all so unreal, like she\u2019s stepped into somebody else\u2019s hotel room. <br>She mutes the television then goes onto the balcony to smoke. It\u2019s so quiet. Everything is far below her, and she feels for a moment like she\u2019s hovering, like maybe she could fly away. <br>It\u2019s 2am. Olive watches every one of her friends\u2019 Instagram stories, searching, until finally she finds Hana in one of the photos, in the background, leaning in while a pair of hands lights her cigarette. She replays the story again, but she can\u2019t tell who the hands belong to. What does it mean, to light someone else\u2019s cigarette? In film it\u2019s a sign of sexual tension. And there Hana is\u2014 a pair of disembodied hands lighting her flame\u2014 and here Olive is, curled up on the couch, with only a baby bird for company. <br>After fifteen minutes of switching her phone on and off, she finally sends a message\u2014When r u hom?\u2014 then lies on the living room floor, instantly regretting it. Her arms itch, are there are small black dots speckling her skin. Her phone lies silent on the floor beside her, and Buddy lowers his beak to it again and again like he wants to crack it open. </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">When she wakes up in the morning, Hana\u2019s face is in her neck and she\u2019s huffing through her nose. Olive stays still and looks around the room at all their things\u2014their clothes and books and records all mixed up together. One of Hana\u2019s drawings the two of them hangs in a black picture frame. They\u2019re wearing party hats and laughing. Next to that is a picture Olive drew of the bird in her scratchy black pen. A bunch of yellow flowers that look like clumps of stale macaroni sits in dirty water on their white dressing table. Leaves and twigs and pages are scattered all over the floor. The nest is upside down and empty. <br>\u2018Babe, wake up.\u2019 <br>\u2018Huh?\u2019 <br>\u2018Buddy\u2019s gone.\u2019 <br>\u2018What?\u2019 <br>Olive unravels herself from Hana\u2019s grip. There\u2019s no sign of Buddy anywhere. The sliding door is open, and the breeze is pushing a fallen polaroid across the floor. Olive whistles from the balcony but there\u2019s no response. </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You don\u2019t even care,\u2019 Olive says as Hana crinkles two tabs of panadol from the foil. She\u2019s been ignoring her for weeks, and now Olive feels so invisible. She feels like nothing. \u2018You don\u2019t care that my bird\u2014our bird\u2014has gone missing, and it was all your fault. You don\u2019t care about anyone but yourself.\u2019 <br>\u2018Can you stop talking for five minutes?\u2019 Hana says, \u2018Can you just stop?\u2019 <br>There\u2019s a buzzing noise loud in Olive\u2019s head and she feels herself tear up again\u2014she\u2019s pathetic\u2014it\u2019s only a bird\u2014Hana\u2019s right\u2014she\u2019s being melodramatic\u2014 she talks too much. <br>\u2018You turn everything into a fight, Olive. I don\u2019t understand why you always do this.\u2019 <br>\u2018Don\u2019t you love him?\u2019 she says. \u2018Don\u2019t you love me?\u2019 <br>\u2018He\u2019s gone, Ollie. Forget about it.\u2019 <br>Olive wants to say something back, but she can\u2019t get any words out. Her throat feels clogged. Hana\u2019s lying on top of the duvet, ankles crossed, arms tucked behind her head, staring at the ceiling. <br>\u2018You\u2019re so cruel,\u2019 Olive says. <br>\u2018You don\u2019t know anything,\u2019 says Hana with traces of a smirk and Olive suddenly hates her, wants to tear that smug expression from her face and scream and spit and drag her by the hair across the floor. <br>She packs a bag. Hana rolls her eyes and says, \u2018You\u2019re so overreacting.\u2019 Olive feels numb the whole time, and then she\u2019s leaving, backpack slung across her shoulder, her eyes stinging with melted mascara. She\u2019s walking down the hallway, half-hoping to hear the sound of Hana\u2019s voice yelling after her. She\u2019s in the elevator, boxed in, and the falling feeling tugs roughly at her gut. </p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She walks for half an hour, up to the top of Cuba street, and back down again.When she gets to Courtney Place, Buddy is there waiting. She asks him why he left. He says nothing. She dodges a bicycle, a skateboard, a mess of prams with babies kicking unhappily up into the air. He flies her to the waterfront. To her left side is the city, so tall that it makes everything else seem trivial, and to her right side is the sea.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Her skin tingles. She\u2019s sweating heavily. She rolls up her sleeves and the black dots have sprouted into thick hairs like wires, with a strange kind of white fluff on the ends. Buddy\u2019s still flying up ahead, and now there are seagulls too, clustered together in the sky, sounding in alarm.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She\u2019s in a carpark and can see the Beehive from here, the sun glowing behind it. The street below is draped in shadow. She goes to say, why are we here, but her voice is a warble. They\u2019re on a narrow road, and Buddy is hopping fast before her. The air is full of mites, illuminated like specks of dust.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">He calls her to him. She feels smaller than ever, and the rest of the world has grown so large. He\u2019s at the door of the ferry terminal, and she can hear what he is thinking. Blue he says, the sky is blue, the sea is blue, the bridge is blue. Olive understands. Her phone clatters to the concrete. She takes a deep breath, then raises both arms to the sky and glides on through.</p>","award":"Wallace Fiction Contest 2019 Youth Prize Winner","publisher":"same same but different","url":"https://www.facebook.com/samesamebutdifferentnz/posts/2299069480186133?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC_J2DsBWsYRb7MdcwBvVt_pCN8FVETi4ciwsLSiYdhbyaFufjU6rrcZuAF7De4xxlulHsq1ZtlNCbIN54v3ehz6Xz06IysqG2Y6u6lXyasqE6vNfK_sAmm7AZCukoIG24-u0h2VVsBHVUNH19-YaEhMkf_FDtVWv00bEMDOnZ8TOr5LafJTJC42jW6UzIR9mHTOXRFTH-mn0CDeWN9TsU44moxa6Y4Be5SJrRRRPxujaS-CFrY4RENsXCr9tqx54OHCgleh7ksS3ybtRtDcI6lw8of_d4cfoglX4ZRy54YfezvIP_Nl6LJOQJG0SCfz1FbCK-cFO7kZEpIcYca2g&__tn__=K-R"},{"id":8,"year":"2019","title":"What the future looks like","poem":" <p class=\\"p1\\">It was a perfect morning. The sky was singing its crisp blue melody, and the birds were swooping overhead, expending neat white pellets at the feet of the people who walked like they had nowhere in particular to go, because they didn\u2019t, it was the beginning of summer, and the days were growing long, and the people were all so happy in a hazy, nostalgic kind of way.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Teresa woke early, made herself a pot of nectarine tea, and sat at the window of her flat. She stared out at the rows of houses, all narrow and tall with small white verandas out the front, where clean bed sheets expanded and contracted in the breeze. She listened to the humming sunshine, which in fact you could hear if you paid close enough attention, and said, \u2018Hello Mr. Sun!\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Hello Teresa!\u2019 The sun smiled back and stretched its beaming arms towards her. \u2018Today is a perfect day!\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Teresa, because the sun was right, everything was perfect \u2014 even the bees greeted the humans cheerfully as they passed, hovering around their shoulders, not to strike, but just to feel the goodness of their companionship.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I can\u2019t believe it,\u2019 said Teresa to the plants sitting patiently on the windowsill. \u2018I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better day on which to graduate!\u2019 Her teeth shone white through a gap between her dark red lips.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Four years had passed. She was finally grown, finally almost free. She put on a green dress and her robe. She hung the hood over her shoulders, and pinned it into place. The gold satin shimmered. Everything was good and right. There was a stream of messages and notifications on her phone, and they were nothing but nice, encouraging, so many gestures of love. She took a moment and closed her eyes, thinking, this is the day I\u2019ve been waiting for all my life.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">A lonely fly buzzed its way into the room, admiring Teresa as she admired herself.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Hello!\u2019 said the fly, \u2018You look wonderful this morning. Would you care if I joined you on your walk?\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Teresa held out her hand and the fly landed neatly in her palm.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Of course, my friend. I would love the company.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The fly flew to rest atop Teresa\u2019s trencher as she went outside. Teresa chattered excitedly about the future, and the fly listened, feeling excited for her too. The past four years hadn\u2019t been easy, but the girl had made it through and now she\u2019d do such incredible things. The fly wasn\u2019t the only one impressed. The houses tilted their roofs towards her as she passed and murmured their congratulations.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Teresa, \u2018Thank you all so very much.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">There was a path laid out before her. She followed it faithfully, each bend and dip and curve, whistling as she walked, until suddenly a rat appeared.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Beware,\u2019 the rat said, its voice unusually low for such an animal. \u2018Today you must walk a new route.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018But I\u2019ve always walked this way, every day for four years, and nothing bad has ever happened to me.\u2019 Teresa took off her trencher to consult the fly, but it was gone.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Today isn\u2019t a normal day, my dear girl.\u2019 The rat appeared once more a few metres in front of her. \u2018You must be wary of everything.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Teresa felt a pressure growing in the back of her skull. She didn\u2019t know what to do. She\u2019d always walked the fastest way, but the rat\u2019s warning frightened her.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She turned down the next street and found herself climbing a steep slope. Patches of sweat formed beneath her armpits and in the crevice of her lower spine. Her feet began to ache in the high heels she\u2019d worn especially for the occasion. She bent down to remove them, but when they were off, she couldn\u2019t pick them back up with her hands. Teresa slid her feet back in, but the shoes had shrunk tighter, and she deduced that if she took them off again they\u2019d no longer fit at all. She kept both of them on and decided to bear it.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She kept walking up the slope until she came to an intersection. The traffic lights shone blue for go. She crossed diagonally, but when she made it halfway across, a car sped before her and she retreated from the shock.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Hurry!\u2019 said the red man now, in short bursts, \u2018Time is running low!\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She went to check her watch but realised that she didn\u2019t have one. Her pockets were empty too, no phone. She ran forward again, dodging more cars and bicycles and telephone poles. The grasses were murmuring low, and she leaned in to hear.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018The fountain, the fountain!\u2019 they chanted. She saw a burst of light in the distance and knew where to go. Teresa charged up the hill, her shoes slicing into the backs of her heels. The satin cape hung heavy around her neck. It felt like she would choke. She lifted it from her neck and hung it from a nearby fence. Her trencher had fallen off somewhere. She didn\u2019t have time to turn back and find it. The tarmac was yelling at her now to hurry, hurry, it was time.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018Go faster!\u2019 yelled a large dog from over the fence.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She sensed an urgency in the dog\u2019s voice and broke into a run. She thought she had more time, but the sun was beginning to go down, and she hoped she hadn\u2019t already missed it. Her feet were bleeding now and her toes had gone numb. Teresa tugged at the shoes but they wouldn\u2019t come off. They\u2019d somehow fused with her foot like a second layer of skin. She fell to her knees and began to crawl, grazing the heels of her palms as she went, the concrete tearing at her kneecaps.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018You\u2019ve made a terrible mistake,\u2019 said the sun in a disappointed tone, before completely disappearing. The sky had turned red.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I only did what they all told me,\u2019 Teresa cried, wiping the sweat from her forehead with the sleeve of her dress \u2014 makeup smudging off onto the green fabric, her eyebrows smeared across her face.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">When she got to the top of the hill, the field was swarming with wasps. She couldn\u2019t see the fountain through the black cloud.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018I made it,\u2019 she said. \u2018Now show me where to go.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">\u2018There is nowhere to go.\u2019 The wasps said, flying around her in circles. \u2018There was never anywhere to go.\u2019</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">And then they laughed at her. They laughed and laughed and laughed.</p>","award":"","publisher":"Oscen: DEMOLISH","url":"http://oscen.co/power/demolish/what-the-future-looks-like/?fbclid=IwAR2JcC1cgdIISA8-6l0359JXlnwZI55XB15zjZjBjvw_pPmJuv6UslUT3wU"},{"id":9,"year":"2019","title":"The River","poem":" <p class=\\"p1\\">it starts with a drip <br><span class=\\"Apple-converted-space\\">&nbsp;

There was a stench of something acrid in the air, like rotting tomatoes, wafting up from the industrial subdivision, circulating through the streets, settling in backyards, amongst the neatly-trimmed hedges and the vegetable gardens. Everything reeked, all the way from Innes street to the river, which was almost black with muck and rubbish. The only escape was the ocean, whose salty sting cut through the stench and cleansed it.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Ava breathed in the fresh sea air as she ran across the dunes, bare feet thudding against the hardened sand. The grass collapsed beneath her, occasionally getting caught between her toes and almost tripping her up, but she kept her balance, holding the glass jar beneath her arm, red hair sticking out in all directions. The sun had barely finished climbing from behind the sea, and already a heatwave had ignited. Her forehead shone with sweat. She kept her steps in a steady rhythm against her ragged breaths.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">It\u2019d never felt natural to run. There was something awkward about the way her legs moved that made it more difficult than it should\u2019ve been for a girl her age, and yet she kept going, puffing loudly, a tight sensation needling beneath her ribs. It didn\u2019t take long to get to the watchtower\u2014 it wasn\u2019t far from the family home, which sat alongside all the other beachfront houses just atop the dunes, looking out over the sea. She stopped to catch her breath. A truck roared by, sputtering out black smoke that lingered over the tarmac.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She continued slowly, making sure to watch her step as she approached the tower, which over the years had become a stick-figure version of itself. Soon the bees would begin to appear; hundreds of tiny bodies scattered through the tussock. Before this summer, she\u2019d never seen so many, and those she had seen were always alive, circling one by one through the flowers in their front yard. Now the dead bodies dotted the landscape all around the watchtower. She blurred her eyes, and the bees became visible through her unfocussed gaze. It was like one of those magic eye games she liked to play, where you stared at a pattern until the secret image pops out.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Everything was going wrong this summer. Even in their house, which was close to the ocean, and which hadn\u2019t been infected by the rotten stench, the air was contaminated with something unhappy. No one in her family spoke, and when they did it was tinged with a hint of melancholy that was so quiet it frightened her. If she got rid of the dead bees, maybe the unhappiness would disappear too.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She picked up the bee carcasses, making sure to handle each one gently, trying not to press them too hard between her fingers. The fuzzy texture of their bodies prickled the pads of her fingers and it made her want to laugh out loud. She talked to the bees as she went along, giving each of them names that started with different letters of the alphabet: Agatha, Bruce, Christine, Dora, Erin, Fran and George... She\u2019d never remember which one was which, but that wasn\u2019t the point. She wanted them to all feel cared for.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She chanted to them, a lucky chant that she\u2019d made up, and after a while set the glass jar at the foot of a dune and stretched her arms out above her head. The ocean tried pointlessly to cling to the shore, despite being sent away again and again.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She tucked the jar of bees safely under her arm again, and as she walked she continued to whisper soothing words. Her skin glowed pink from being so long in the sun. The row of houses came into view, but nobody was outside yet. Everyone would still be having breakfast, or lying in bed with a book, or vacuuming their carpets while the weekend news on the television blared in the background.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Ava tapped the door frame three times before stepping inside. She placed both feet on a different floorboard so she wouldn\u2019t step on any cracks. Her father\u2019s voice came from the kitchen\u2014<em>Absolutely overreacting, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being so stubborn about this</em>\u2014and her mother yelled back\u2014<em>You don\u2019t get to talk down to me. We didn\u2019t raise our children to behave like that. I can\u2019t let her choose that way of life\u2014</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Her parents stopped yelling as soon as they saw her. Mum was crying and dad looked like he was in pain. They stood in opposite corners of the kitchen, like wrestlers. Ava wordlessly held up the jar, which was a quarter of the way filled with bees. Their small brown bodies rolled over one another as the jar moved.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Her mum put her hand over her mouth and started to cry.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>Give us a second, darling,</em> said her dad. <em>Go wake your sister up will you?</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The bees weren\u2019t supposed to make anyone sad.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Ava slid back down the corridor and tapped three times on Jessica\u2019s door before entering. Jessica\u2019s room had so much lovely stuff in it\u2014all of her books and clothes and trinkets and photographs and postcards she\u2019d been collecting her whole life. Ava couldn\u2019t even dream of having so much stuff, but then she was less than half Jessica\u2019s age. When Jess had moved out last year Ava started spending lots of time in her room, playing with her old stuffed toys, looking at the pictures on the backs of her postcards and imagining her way into them. She\u2019d looked forward to Jess\u2019 return and imagined they\u2019d play all the time when she got home. But Jess didn\u2019t talk to her anymore. She didn\u2019t talk to anybody. She slept during the day and went out late at night, and then came back yelling\u2014 like last night, when she\u2019d been screaming and throwing things and Ava had been woken up by it, had crept down the hall to see pieces of her mother\u2019s favourite coffee mug scattered over the kitchen floor. Maybe it was Jess being home that made their house sad, but Ava didn\u2019t want her to leave.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She approached the lump in the bed and prodded it gently with her finger. <em>Wakey wakey!</em> she said and Jess answered with an unpleasant groan. <em>I found so many more bees this morning!&nbsp;</em>She climbed up to sit on the foot of the bed and bounced up and down so that Jess would wake up. The bees in the jar bounced too.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>Ava,</em> <em>get out\u2014</em> <em>But I want you to see\u2014 I\u2019m sleeping. Get out!</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Ava peeled the blanket away from her sister\u2019s face. Her hair was like a bush and her eye makeup was smudged all the way down her face, like a sad sweaty clown.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>Out!</em> Jess yelled again, and Ava jumped to the floor with the bees under her arm. There were pieces of torn paper scattered everywhere. She picked one up. It had angry red pen all across it. Jess yelled at her again.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><em>You\u2019re not nice in the mornings!</em> Ava said, before slamming the door. She couldn\u2019t read the scribbled words on the paper. It said something about a spirit, but it was like having a lone puzzle piece, it didn\u2019t make sense by itself.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The yelling had stopped. The house was quiet. There was no one else to talk to. Ava stood in the corridor alone, hugging the glass jar, watching the sea breeze blow the living room curtains back and forth.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\">* * *</p> <p class=\\"p2\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The sun infiltrated through a gap in the curtain, slicing in a clean line across Jess\u2019 legs. Around her sat all of the things she\u2019d collected through her life, but she couldn\u2019t feel anything for them. The debating trophies, the certificates for good manners or the most improved in spelling, the high school badges that she\u2019d once pinned proudly to the lapel of her prefect uniform, all of it seemed insignificant. There were more important things to think about.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She thought about texting Natalie\u2014 <em>Big fight with mum last night\u2014 Can\u2019t remember what I said\u2014 I miss you\u2014 I love you\u2014</em> but her phone was still lying, almost dead, in her denim jacket thrown halfway across the room and she couldn\u2019t find the energy to retrieve it. It would\u2019ve been better to just stay in Wellington the whole summer, drinking cider on the beach in Lyall Bay, watching the sunset from the roof of their flat, out in Rongotai, where you could see the planes taking off from the airport. To have Natalie there. To have her friends who knew her, better than her own parents did. Coming home meant she had to retreat back into the skin of the old Jess who never spoke up for herself, who was always so polite.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Summer with her parents was supposed to be healing. It was supposed to be a time for all of them to connect. For the past two months she\u2019d been playing a role, saying all the right things, and being silent when she disagreed. Then a week before Christmas, her mum had read her Facebook messages to Natalie. She still had no idea how far she\u2019d scrolled, but it didn\u2019t matter. Her mother knew. That was the worst thing\u2014 knowing that the secret didn\u2019t belong to her anymore, and knowing also that it hadn\u2019t been her choice to tell it.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She remembered the tear tracks down her mum\u2019s face, and the words <em>I just feel sorry for you&nbsp;</em>said like she was standing at the side of Jess\u2019 grave, and Jess had felt so ashamed, like she was really disgusting. She\u2019d shut herself up in her room and refused to speak to anyone, not even Ava when she told her about the bees, not even Liam when he asked her to go swimming, and the entire time things were turning bad. The smell from outside made its way into her room.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Her mother\u2019s voice came from the lounge, <em>Mark\u2019s gone and shut all the windows, I told him, we need a constant air flow or else the house will start to stink\u2014 Where is that horrible smell coming from? You would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d have fixed the problem by now\u2014&nbsp;</em>It was a private rambling with herself. Or maybe she was talking to God again, like she always claimed to do, as if God was just another number on her phone she could dial whenever she wanted.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Jess opened the door of her bedroom. Her mother\u2019s hands were gripping tightly to the iron as she pressed down, making short sharp movements, elbow jerking sideways like she was jabbing it into someone\u2019s side. The windows were all open.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Jess wanted to say something. She wanted to tell her mum that she missed her, that she was sorry, that she needed her to listen. She wanted to be a child again, a child with secrets. To be held and for everything to be okay. To still believe in heaven and to make it there, with all of her grandparents and her aunties and her mum and dad, and to be able to stay with them, always, to be included<em>\u2014if love is never shared, it becomes stagnant and it dies\u2014</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">She went back into her room and shut the door. Her eyes were wet. She climbed through the window sideways and landed in the grass in her bare feet, a shock jolting through her calves.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">The air outside was thick with the rotting smell. She was in nothing but her oversized t-shirt, her hair flying messily around her head as she ran, the wind picking up like it was telling her not to leave, and her head still pounding, but she bolted on. Ava shouted from above, <em>Where are you going? Are you okay?</em></p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Jess wept.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Her breath was shaking, and her stomach was sore. The sun flared and hit her eyes. Around a lonely flower, a bee circled up into the light.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\\"p3\\"> <br> </p>","award":"","publisher":"RNZ National","url":"https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/thereading/audio/2018706246/heatwave-by-sinead-overbye"}],"otherProjects":[{"id":"1","projectName":"French Girls zine (2017) [physical copy only]","url":""},{"id":"2","projectName":"Hinemoana zine (2019) [physical copy only]","url":""},{"id":"3","projectName":"Artworks\u2014French Girls and Swimmers series\u2019","url":"https://www.instagram.com/applecarcassart/"}],"upcommingProjects":[{"id":"1","projectName":"Once Were Writers Podcast with Michelle Rahurahu Scott","url":""},{"id":"2","projectName":"GIRLZ GIRLZ GIRLZ zine with Rebecca Hawkes and Joy Holley","url":""}]}')},49:function(s,n,e){s.exports=e.p+"static/media/sss.636df72f.jpg"},54:function(s,n,e){s.exports=e(115)},97:function(s,n){}},[[54,1,2]]]);
